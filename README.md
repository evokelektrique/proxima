# Getting started
This section describes how to install and configure the plugin.

## Features

   - [X] Sync WordPress posts, including **(Create, Update, Delete)** across all trusted nodes
   - [X] Sync WordPress pages, including **(Create, Update, Delete)** across all trusted nodes
   - [ ] Sync WordPress comments
   - [ ] Sync WordPress users
   - [ ] Sync WooCommerce products

## Installation

To install this plugin, you can easily navigate to the plugins page in your WordPress dashboard and search for `Replicant` plugin name and simply click on the **install** button.

The other way is by cloning the repo with `git clone https://github.com/evokelektrique/replicant` command and build the project by running the `./build.sh` shell script.

## Configuration

First, all your WordPress websites have to have this plugin installed already. Once that's set up, you need to configure your nodes according to the **Trust model** and when the target node accepted your request, your content will be synced from now on.

> Note that currently the depth limit of nodes could be only 1 and maybe in futrue updates we will increase the limit.

> I've seen things you people wouldn't believe... Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion... I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the TannhÃ¤user Gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain... Time to die.
