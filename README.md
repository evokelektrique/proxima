# Replicant
A plugin that replicates and synchronize content in your WordPress websites.

### Features
   - [X] Sync WordPress posts, including **(Create, Update, Delete)**
   - [X] Sync WordPress pages, including **(Create, Update, Delete)**
   - [ ] Sync WordPress comments
   - [ ] Sync WordPress users
   - [ ] Sync WooCommerce products

## How it works
First, all your WordPress websites have to have this plugin installed already. Once that's set up, you need to configure your nodes according to the **Trust model** and when the target node accepted your request, your content will be synced from now on.

## TODO
   - [ ] Logs Expiration
   - [ ] Add `acting as` model
   - [ ] Add `Post` publisher check how should current node act based on its `acting_as`
   - [ ] Better UI and CSS styles
   - [ ] Better logging
